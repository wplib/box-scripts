# W010 - Error image doesn't conform to JSON config format in 0.16 or later.

## Cause
Usually an error returned from the `box` command with any of the sub-commands `install`, `start`, `stop`, `rm`, `clean` and `refresh`.
The specified container image is not using the WPLib Box JSON string that is present in all images from WPLib Box version 0.16 and onwards.

## Common fixes
You may have to upgrade to WPLib Box 0.16 or later.
Alternatively start the container manually.
