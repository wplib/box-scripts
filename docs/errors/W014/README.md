# W014 - Error container can't be started.

## Cause
Usually an error returned from the `box` command with any of the sub-commands `install`, `start`, `stop`, `rm`, `clean` and `refresh`.
The specified container can't be started. Due to several reasons:
* The container doesn't exist.
* Another container is already listening on ports that are required by this container.

## Common fixes
Check to make sure that the container exists - `container ls`
Check to ensure no other container is listening on required ports - check the error message from the box command.
