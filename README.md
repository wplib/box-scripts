#Box Scripts for the WPLib Box


## Installation
Box Scripts contain scripts designed for both running _**inside**_ WPLib Box as well as running alongside WPLib Box on the host computer. 

If you are using the latest &mdash; [WPLib Box 0.10.9 or later](https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box) &mdash; it will automatically have been installed.

## Getting Help
After that type `box` to get a list of commands, or explicitly specify `help`:

    box help

Do NOT forget to first enter the WPLib Box command line by first running this command from your *host* computer's command line:

    vagrant ssh

## Status/Disclaimer

This is VERY MUCH a work-in-progress, and WILL CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY over time.

If you want to use it plan up updating it and not building scripts that depend on it as they will break.
